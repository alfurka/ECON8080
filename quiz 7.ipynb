    "*In the Ramsey model example, we know that (a) if the guess of $c(0)$ is \"too high\", capital eventually starts decreasing, and if the guess of $c(0)$ is \"too low\", consumption eventually starts decreasing. Propose an algorithm that pins down the \"correct\" $c(0)$. Hint: think of a \"bisection\"-like method. *\n"
